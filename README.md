# FLOWAMOK

A traffic simulation for the ages.  Maybe a game at some point.

It's a stencil and then some.  Work in progress!

Requires [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org) and SDL2 and SDL2-ttf
libraries with associated header files.


## Building and running

First run `futhark pkg sync` once.

Then run `make run` to build and run in a window.


## Controls

Press Space to step through the simulation.
